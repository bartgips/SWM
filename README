Manuscript.pdf contains an old version of the scientific article explaining its use. (for when you cannot access the final paper)

Code all runs in MATLAB

(optional)
requires fieldTrip toolbox for filtering of signals

main functions: 
bg_SWM.m: apply SWM
bg_swm_extract.m: extract motifs from the data after bg_SWM.m has finished

subdirectories are related to generating figures and data for paper:
